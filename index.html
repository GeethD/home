		<h1 id = "Top">Mission To Mars</h1>
		
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			
		<p>
				From hostile deserts to lonely islands, wherever there is space to expand humans do so. We live in a society where life is ever-changing and is constantly affected due to issues like Global Warming and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change";>Climate Change</a>. Every day the situation gets worse due to excessive pollution. We need a place to rest, a place to begin a new chapter. This is why Mars Exploration is worth the investment. The main reason for this mission is that we need an alternative for a habitable planet because life on Earth is not guaranteed. Furthermore, Mars exploration and settlement will lead to more innovations that could help in different situations, such as water-saving techniques. Finally, Mars exploration will spark youth interest in space expiration and other sciences, and create more job opportunities for people. This is why I support an investment dedicated to Mars Exploration.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Reason 1: Alternative for a habitable planet</h2>
			
		<p>
				The first reason for taking the next step is the fact that we need an alternative for a habitable planet because life on Earth is not guaranteed. Climate change is a serious problem on our planet. The greenhouse effect is an effect that traps the Sun’s warmth in Earth’s lower atmosphere. Pollution just extends this process and ultimately increases the overall temperature. Climate change also causes erratic and unpredictable weather. Climate change has disastrous ramifications such as an increase in sea levels, poor air quality, and diseases transmitted by insects and rodents. To prevent this catastrophe, the government will have to spend anywhere from $300 Billion to $50 Trillion. A mission to Mars just costs $2.5 Billion. A small price to pay for a larger dream. This just goes to say, Earth will not stay habitable if we continue our behaviour, we need another possible habitat.
		</p>
			
			
		<h2>Reason 2: Will lead to greater inventions</h2>
				
		<p>
				Furthermore, Mars exploration and settlement will lead to more innovations that could help in different situations. There are still a lot of questions we have about the planet Mars. Are there signs of extraterrestrial life on Mars? Heck, there could be life on Mars that we haven’t discovered yet! Researching and planning for a mission can lead to several other innovations such as water-saving techniques. For example, as we investigate we might find a way to carry more fuel to accommodate the journey. Not only will this help during space missions, but will also come useful on Earth! Inventions like the Memory Foam, Safety Grooving, and Anti-Shock Trousers are all NASA - Derived Technology. Mars Exploration will benefit everyone, Astronauts or Humans.
		</p>
			
		<h2>Reason 3: Will spark interest in youth</h2>
		
		<p>
				Finally, Mars exploration will spark youth interest in space expiration and other sciences, and create more job opportunities for people. A lot of children and young adults will be interested in this “Mission to Mars” once it has gone public. Suddenly kids who take delight in Space will be stepping into leadership positions. For example, the CSA shares resources with educators to inspire young Canadians through fun learning activities. They offer internships and student jobs to give students real-life experience and to support research, awareness and learning in space science and technology. Aside from sparking youth interest, Mars exploration will also create a multitude of job opportunities for people. Engineers will band together for various jobs, such as automation, mechanics, and robotics. Since the inception of Curiosity, Webster University said that about 3,000 NASA employees have worked on the project, in addition to about 4,000 non-government workers from various companies. It’s a win-win situation for NASA, the regular civilians, and qualified individuals. This mission could single-handedly change a child’s perception about space and their careers/goals.

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			
		<p>
				“You’re never too old to set another goal or dream another dream” - C.S. Lewis. The Mission to Mars may be a while away, but it’s worth the wait. This mission resembles hope, determination, and unity. Investments towards Mars Exploration are worth it! First and foremost, with global issues like climate change, life on our planet is not assured. We need another possible home that we can settle on. Additionally, continuing to study this topic will lead to the birth of other inventions such as water-saving technologies. Ultimately, Mars exploration will offer interest in children all across the globe, as well as providing countless job opportunities for people in need. This is why a Mission to Mars is worth the investment.
